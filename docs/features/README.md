# Feature map

One document per feature — end-to-end context, file:line references, data flow from user click to rendered result. Maintained by the `feature-context-curator` agent.

## How to read a feature doc

Every entry here points to a file that contains, for one feature:

- Purpose and user-visible behavior
- End-to-end data flow (click → hook → HTTP → controller → service → model → response → cache → re-render)
- HTTP API surface (methods, paths, status codes, Zod schemas)
- Backend layers touched (routes / controllers / services / models / middleware)
- Shared contracts (`@app/shared` DTOs consumed by both sides)
- Frontend slice (`api.ts`, hooks, components, pages, routes, state)
- Observable states (idle / loading / empty / error / success)
- Tests that cover it
- Known gaps and TODOs

All concrete claims use `path:line` references so the reader can click straight into the code.
